{\Large{\bf Problem 1:}} Let $A$ be a $2$x$2$ matrix such that det($A$)$= 6$ and \[ adj(A)= \left( \begin{array}{ccc}1 & 2  \\
4 & 6  \end{array} \right)\]

Compute $A^{-1}$

{\Large{\bf Problem 2:}} Using Gaussian elimination, it takes approximately $n^3/3$ operations to solve the problem $Ax=b$, where $A$ is an $n$x$n$ matrix. A modern CPU (for example, an overclocked AMD FX 6300) can perform an operation approximately once every 0.25 nanoseconds (1 nanosecond is $10^{-9}$ seconds).

Approximately how long will it take a modern computer to solve this problem, given...

a) a $100$x$100$ matrix?

b) a $100,000$x$100,000$ matrix?

c) a $1,000,000$x$1,000,000$ matrix?

(Hint: $1/12$ is approximately $0.083$, there are $3600$ seconds in an hour, and there are $365$ days in a year.)

(Hint 2: You should feel very comfortable giving a very rough answer.)
