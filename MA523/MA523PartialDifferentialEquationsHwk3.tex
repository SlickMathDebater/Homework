{\bf Problem 1: Problem 6 in textbook:}

Let $U$ be a bounded, open subset of $\R^n$. 

%Use problem 5 to do this: the hint is subharmonic. So, we can write the maximum of the hint as the maximum of the hint on the boundary. So because $U$ is bounded, we can perform some estimates that get us what we need.

{\bf Problem 2: Problem 9 in textbook:}

Let $u$ be the solution of 

\begin{displaymath}
   \left\{
     \begin{array}{lr}
       \De u = 0 & \text{ in } \R_+^n\\
       u=g & \text{ on }\partial \R_+^n
     \end{array}
   \right.
\end{displaymath}

Assume $g$ is bounded and $g(x) = \absval{x}$ for $x \in \partial \R_+^n$ with $\absval{x}\leq 1$.

Consider $Du$.

%We have a green's function, and thus a representation of $u$. It may be of value to bash this and the hint together...
