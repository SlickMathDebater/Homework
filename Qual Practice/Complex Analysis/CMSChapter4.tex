{\bf Problem 1:}

Consider $\text{Ind}(\partial D(a,r),a)$. Define $\tha: [0,1] \to \R$ by $x \to 2\pi x$. Note that $\tha$ satisfies $\ga(t) - a = \absval{\ga(t) - a} e^{i \tha (t)}$, where $\ga(t) = re^{2\pi t}+a$. From the definitions, we have

\begin{align*}
\text{Ind}(\partial D(a,r),a) &= \frac{1}{2\pi} (\tha (1) - \tha(0))\\
&= \frac{1}{2\pi} (\tha (1) - \tha(0))\\
&= 1
\end{align*}

{\bf Problem 2:}

Consider $\text{Ind}(\partial D(a,r),z)$. Because $\partial D(a,r)$ is a smooth, closed curve, we have that $\text{Ind}(\partial D(a,r),z) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int\limits_{\partial D(a,r)} \frac{dw}{w-z}$.

So,

\begin{align*}
\text{Ind}(\partial D(a,r),z) &= \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int\limits_{\partial D(a,r)} \frac{dw}{w-z}\\
&= \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int\limits_{\partial D(z,r)} \frac{dw}{w-z}\\
&=\frac{1}{2\pi i} 2 \pi i\\
=1
\end{align*}

if $z \in D(a,r)$.

And

\begin{align*}
\text{Ind}(\partial D(a,r),z) &= \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int\limits_{\partial D(a,r)} \frac{dw}{w-z}\\
&= \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int\limits_{\partial D(z,r)} \frac{dw}{w-z}\\
&=0
\end{align*}

if $z \notin D(a,r)$ (as the function is holomorphic on that disk.)

Note that in our definitions, the index isn't defined when $a \in \ga^*$. That is, $\text{Ind}(\partial D(a,r),z)$ isn't defined when $z \in \partial D(a,r)$.

{\bf Problem 3:}

Let $V$ be an open subset of the plane and $\Ga$ be a cycle in $V$. Also, let $\Ga$ have the property that $\text{Ind}(\Ga, a) =0$ for all $a \in \C \setminus V$.

Let $f \in H(V)$.

Then define $g(w) = \frac{f(w)}{w-z}$. We know that $g$ is differentiable on $V \setminus \{z\}$. Referring to a figure much like Figure 2.1 and using Theorem 4.10 to show that the ``outer'' chunks of the integral vanish, we get $\int\limits_{\Ga} g(w) dw = \text{Ind}(z,\Ga) \int\limits_{\partial D(z,r)} g(w)dw$ for arbitrarily small $r>0$.

Yet, by inserting definitions, we see that $\int\limits_{\partial D(z,r)} g(w) dw = i\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi} g(z+re^{it})dt$. As $r \to 0$, we $g(w+re^{it}) \to g(z)$ uniformly. Thus, the integral given evaluates to $2\pi i g(z)$, yielding the desired result.

{\bf Problem 4:}

Let $V$ be simply connected, $\ga$ be a smooth closed curve in $V$, and $a \in \C \setminus V$. Then $\text{Ind}(a, \ga) = \text{Ind}(a, \al)$ where $\al$ is a curve that is constant with respect to time. Now, $\text{Ind}(a,\al) = 0$, and this can be computed readily.

\shunt

{\bf Problem 5:}

Let $V$ be a convex open set, and $\ga$ a smooth, closed curve in $V$. Pick a point in $\ga^*$; call it $a$.

The map $f: [0,1]^2 \to V$ given by $f(t,s) = $ is a homotopy. Moreover, %stuff. Figure out how homotopies work.

\shunt

{\bf Problem 6:}

Let $f$ be a nonvanishing holomorphic function on a simply connected set, $V$. Then there is a holomorphic $g$ such that $f=e^g$. Consider $h=g/2$. Then $f=e^{2h} = (e^h)^2$. But $e^h$ is holomorphic, as it is a composition of holomorphic maps. So, $e^h$ is a holomorphic square root of $f$.

{\bf Problem 9:}

Consider $f$, holomorphic on some disk, $\Om$, centered at $z$. Consider $g(w) = \frac{f(w)}{w-z}$; then we have that $\int\limits_{\partial Om} g(w) dw= 2\pi i \text{Res}_z g$. (Note that $g$'s only singularity is at $z$.) Moreover, note that $g(w) = \frac{\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty a_n(w-z)^n}{w-z}$. Thus, by the residue theorem, $\int\limits_{\partial \Om} \frac{f(w)}{w-z} dw = f(z)$.
